# A Front End (React & SASS) TS Library, and testing platform, trying Vite (for now...)


## Copyright Paul Kirkaas (pkirkaas@gmail.com): 17-Oct-2023 21:42

## Basics

A very experimental fe library using React & Vite to build the front end, and the Pk-Ts-Common library

Not sure Vite is the way to go, and things change fast, so all has to be double-checked & updated.

## Build & Test

As of 17 Oct 2023 -

Run:

```bash
 npm run clean
 npm run build
 npm run preview
 ```

 Not as it should be, for now with EACH change of .tsx, whatever, have to re-run BOTH:

```bash
 npm run build
 npm run preview
 ```
